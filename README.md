You have discovered a tiny talking kitten called Kevin.

Kevin answers 'Yes please' if you ask him a question.

Kevin answers 'Leave me alone' if you shout at him.

Kevin says 'Cat got your tongue?' if you get his attention but don't actually say anything.

Kevin says 'Pastel de nata' when you ask him "What is your favourite food?"

He answers 'Meow' to anything else.

```bash
$ npm install
